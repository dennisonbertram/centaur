# Learning Path

Centaur has several surfaces: operator setup, Slack entrypoints, the Agent API, tool plugins, durable workflows, sandbox harnesses, overlays, and internal apps. Use this page to choose a reading order instead of reading the docs front to back.

:::tip
If you have not booted Centaur yet, start with [Quickstart](/quickstart). Everything below assumes you either have a working local stack or know which deployment you are targeting.

## By experience level

| Level | Goal | Reading order | Time |
|-------|------|---------------|------|
| Beginner | Understand what Centaur is and run one local turn | [Why Centaur](/why-centaur) -> [Quickstart](/quickstart) -> [First API Call](/first-call) | 45-90 min |
| Operator | Configure a shared Slack/API deployment | [Operating Model](/concepts/operating-model) -> [Set Up Centaur](/setup) -> [Connector Setup](/ops/connectors) -> [Golden Path](/tutorials/golden-path) | 2-4 hours |
| Platform engineer | Understand internals and production boundaries | [Architecture](/concepts/architecture) -> [Agent Harnesses](/ops/harnesses) -> [Permissioning](/ops/permissioning) -> [Scaling](/ops/scaling) | 3-6 hours |
| Extension author | Add tools, workflows, skills, or apps | [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices) -> [Plugin Model](/extend/plugins) -> [Build a Tool](/tutorials/tool) -> [Build a Workflow](/tutorials/workflow) -> [Build a Web App](/tutorials/app) | 2-5 hours |
| Contributor | Change core behavior safely | [Contributing](/contributing) -> [Architecture](/concepts/architecture) -> [Deploy Changes](/tutorials/deploy) -> relevant API reference | Varies |

## By use case

### "I want to see it work locally"

1. [Quickstart](/quickstart)
2. [FAQ & Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting)
3. [First API Call](/first-call)

Stop when a local `PONG` turn succeeds. That is your stable baseline.

### "I want a Slack agent for my team"

1. [Set Up Centaur](/setup)
2. [Connector Setup](/ops/connectors)
3. [Agent Harnesses](/ops/harnesses)
4. [Permissioning](/ops/permissioning)
5. [Golden Path](/tutorials/golden-path)

The first production proof should be a Slack mention that creates a sandbox, runs the selected harness, and posts the final result back to the thread.

### "I want to call Centaur from another app"

1. [First API Call](/first-call)
2. [Agent API](/api/agent)
3. [Tools API](/api/tools)
4. [Apps API](/api/apps)

Use direct tool calls when the app already knows the operation. Use the Agent API when Centaur should plan, call tools, and write the final response.

### "I want to add a private integration"

1. [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices)
2. [Plugin Model](/extend/plugins)
3. [Build a Tool](/tutorials/tool)
4. [Connector Setup](/ops/connectors)

Keep secrets in the secret backend and expose only the narrow tool methods agents need.

### "I want durable automation"

1. [Build a Workflow](/tutorials/workflow)
2. [Workflows API](/api/workflows)
3. [Deploy Changes](/tutorials/deploy)
4. [Scaling](/ops/scaling)

Use workflows when the job needs checkpoints, sleeps, retries, child workflows, or events. Use a direct agent turn for one immediate answer.

### "I want org-specific behavior without forking"

1. [Overlay Operating Model](/ops/overlays)
2. [Use with Your AI Agent](/tutorials/skill-file)
3. [Build a Skill](/tutorials/skill)
4. [Deploy Changes](/tutorials/deploy)

Put deployment-specific prompts, skills, tools, and workflows in overlays so the base repo stays upgradeable.

## Feature map

| Feature | What it does | Start here |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Agent API | Durable spawn, message, execute, stream, cancel, release | [Agent API](/api/agent) |
| Tools | Python clients exposed as authenticated REST endpoints | [Build a Tool](/tutorials/tool) |
| Workflows | Checkpointed long-running jobs with sleeps, retries, events, and child runs | [Build a Workflow](/tutorials/workflow) |
| Skills | Reusable agent instructions loaded on demand | [Build a Skill](/tutorials/skill) |
| Apps | Internal UIs deployed through the app plane | [Build a Web App](/tutorials/app) |
| Harnesses | Amp, Claude Code, Codex, and compatible sandbox adapters | [Agent Harnesses](/ops/harnesses) |
| Overlays | Deployment-specific extensions layered after the base repo | [Overlay Operating Model](/ops/overlays) |
| Permissioning | API keys, sandbox tokens, Slack boundaries, and secret injection | [Permissioning](/ops/permissioning) |
